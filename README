NAME
    ORLite::Pod - Documentation generator for ORLite

SYNOPSIS
      orlite2pod Class::Name

DESCRIPTION
    *This initial release is intended to test whether or not search.cpan.org
    gets confused by the heredoc POD fragments in this file. Use of this
    module is not recommended for any users at this time*

    THIS MODULE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

    The biggest downside of ORLite is that because it can generate you an
    entire ORM in one line of code, you can have a large an extensive API
    without anywhere for documentation for the API to exist.

    The result is quick efficient creation of APIs that nobody can
    understand or use :)

    ORLite::Pod was created to fix this problem by allowing you to keep your
    slimline Perl module as is, but generating a tree of .pod files
    alongside the regular modules containing the documentation for the API.

    ORLite::Pod connects directly to a loaded ORLite instance, interrogating
    it to find the database it connects to, and discovering which tables
    have or don't have classes generated for them.
