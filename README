NAME
    ORLite::Pod - Documentation generator for ORLite

SYNOPSIS
      my $generator = ORLite::Pod->new(
          from   => 'My::Project::DB',
          to     => 'My-Project/lib',
          author => 'Adam Kennedy',
          email  => 'adamk@cpan.org',
      );
      
  $generator->run;

DESCRIPTION
    The biggest downside of ORLite is that because it can generate you an
    entire ORM in one line of code, you can have a large an extensive API
    without anywhere for documentation for the API to exist.

    The result is quick efficient creation of APIs that nobody can
    understand or use :)

    ORLite::Pod was created to fix this problem by allowing you to keep your
    slimline Perl module as is, but generating a tree of .pod files
    alongside the regular modules containing the documentation for the API.

    ORLite::Pod connects directly to a loaded ORLite instance, interrogating
    it to find the database it connects to, and discovering which tables
    have or don't have classes generated for them.
