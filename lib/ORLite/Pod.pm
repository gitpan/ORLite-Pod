=head1 NAME

ORLite::Pod - Documentation generator for ORLite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $generator = ORLite::Pod->new(
      from   => 'My::Project::DB',
      to     => 'My-Project/lib',
      author => 'Adam Kennedy',
      email  => 'adamk@cpan.org',
  );
  
  $generator->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The biggest downside of L<ORLite> is that because it can generate you
an entire ORM in one line of code, you can have a large an extensive
API without anywhere for documentation for the API to exist.

The result is quick efficient creation of APIs that nobody can
understand or use :)

B<ORLite::Pod> was created to fix this problem by allowing you to keep
your slimline Perl module as is, but generating a tree of .pod files
alongside the regular modules containing the documentation for the API.

B<ORLite::Pod> connects directly to a loaded ORLite instance,
interrogating it to find the database it connects to, and discovering
which tables have or don't have classes generated for them.

# Root Template

sub template_db { <<'END_TT' }
|=head1 NAME
|
|[%+ pkg %] - An ORLite-based ORM Database API
|
|=head1 DESCRIPTION
|
|TO BE COMPLETED
|
|=head1 METHODS
|
[% IF method.dsn %]
|=head2 dsn
|
|  my $string = [%+ pkg %]->dsn;
|
|The C<dsn> accessor returns the L<DBI> connection string used to connect
|to the SQLite database as a string.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.dbh %]
|=head2 dbh
|
|  my $handle = [%+ pkg %]->dbh;
|
|To reliably prevent potential L<SQLite> deadlocks resulting from multiple
|connections in a single process, each ORLite package will only ever
|maintain a single connection to the database.
|
|During a transaction, this will be the same (cached) database handle.
|
|Although in most situations you should not need a direct DBI connection
|handle, the C<dbh> method provides a method for getting a direct
|connection in a way that is compatible with connection management in
|L<ORLite>.
|
|Please note that these connections should be short-lived, you should
|never hold onto a connection beyond your immediate scope.
|
|The transaction system in ORLite is specifically designed so that code
|using the database should never have to know whether or not it is in a
|transation.
|
|Because of this, you should B<never> call the -E<gt>disconnect method
|on the database handles yourself, as the handle may be that of a
|currently running transaction.
|
|Further, you should do your own transaction management on a handle
|provided by the <dbh> method.
|
|In cases where there are extreme needs, and you B<absolutely> have to
|violate these connection handling rules, you should create your own
|completely manual DBI-E<gt>connect call to the database, using the connect
|string provided by the C<dsn> method.
|
|The C<dbh> method returns a L<DBI::db> object, or throws an exception on
|error.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.begin %]
|=head2 begin
|
|  [%+ pkg %]->begin;
|
|The C<begin> method indicates the start of a transaction.
|
|In the same way that ORLite allows only a single connection, likewise
|it allows only a single application-wide transaction.
|
|No indication is given as to whether you are currently in a transaction
|or not, all code should be written neutrally so that it works either way
|or doesn't need to care.
|
|Returns true or throws an exception on error.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.commit %]
|=head2 commit
|
|  [%+ pkg %]->commit;
|
|The C<commit> method commits the current transaction. If called outside
|of a current transaction, it is accepted and treated as a null operation.
|
|Once the commit has been completed, the database connection falls back
|into auto-commit state. If you wish to immediately start another
|transaction, you will need to issue a separate -E<gt>begin call.
|
|Returns true or throws an exception on error.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.rollback %]
|=head2 rollback
|
|The C<rollback> method rolls back the current transaction. If called outside
|of a current transaction, it is accepted and treated as a null operation.
|
|Once the rollback has been completed, the database connection falls back
|into auto-commit state. If you wish to immediately start another
|transaction, you will need to issue a separate -E<gt>begin call.
|
|If a transaction exists at END-time as the process exits, it will be
|automatically rolled back.
|
|Returns true or throws an exception on error.
|
|=head2 do
|
|  [%+ pkg %]->do(
|      'insert into table ( foo, bar ) values ( ?, ? )', {},
|      \$foo_value,
|      \$bar_value,
|  );
|
|The C<do> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent L<DBI> method,
|but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectall_arrayref %]
|=head2 selectall_arrayref
|
|The C<selectall_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectall_hashref %]
|=head2 selectall_hashref
|
|The C<selectall_hashref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectcol_arrayref %]
|=head2 selectcol_arrayref
|
|The C<selectcol_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectrow_array %]
|=head2 selectrow_array
|
|The C<selectrow_array> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectrow_arrayref %]
|=head2 selectrow_arrayref
|
|The C<selectrow_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.selectrow_hashref %]
|=head2 selectrow_hashref
|
|The C<selectrow_hashref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction.
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.prepare %]
|=head2 prepare
|
|The C<prepare> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
|L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
|or transaction
|
|It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
|behaviour.
|
|In general though, you should try to avoid the use of your own prepared
|statements if possible, although this is only a recommendation and by
|no means prohibited.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.pragma %]
|=head2 pragma
|
|  # Get the user_version for the schema
|  my $version = [% pkg %]->pragma('user_version');
|
|The C<pragma> method provides a convenient method for fetching a pragma
|for a database. See the L<SQLite> documentation for more details.

# Table Template

sub template_table { <<'END_TT' }
|=head1 NAME
|
|[%+ pkg %] - [% root %] class for the [% table.name %] table
|
|=head1 DESCRIPTION
|
|TO BE COMPLETED
|
|=head1 METHODS
|
[% IF method.base %]
|=head2 base
|
|  # Returns '[% root %]'
|  my $namespace = [% pkg %]->base;
|
|Normally you will only need to work directly with a table class,
|and only with one ORLite package.
|
|However, if for some reason you need to work with multiple ORLite packages
|at the same time without hardcoding the root namespace all the time, you
|can determine the root namespace from an object or table class with the
|C<base> method.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.table %]
|=head2 table
|
|  # Returns '[% table.name %]'
|  print [% pkg %]->table;
|
|While you should not need the name of table for any simple operations,
|from time to time you may need it programatically. If you do need it,
|you can use the C<table> method to get the table name.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.load %]
|=head2 load
|
|  my $object = [% pkg %]->load( $[% table.pk %] );
|
|If your table has single column primary key, a C<load> method will be
|generated in the class. If there is no primary key, the method is not
|created.
|
|The C<load> method provides a shortcut mechanism for fetching a single
|object based on the value of the primary key. However it should only
|be used for cases where your code trusts the record to already exists.
|
|It returns a C<[% pkg %]> object, or throws an exception if the
|object does not exist.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.select %]
|=head2 select
|
|  # Get all objects in list context
|  my @list = [% pkg %]->select;
|  
|  # Get a subset of objects in scalar context
|  my $array_ref = [% pkg %]->select(
|      'where [% table.pk %] > ? order by [% table.pk %]',
|      1000,
|  );
|
|The C<select> method executes a typical SQL C<SELECT> query on the
|[%+ table.name %] table.
|
|It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
|C<FROM [% table.name %]> section of the query, followed by variables
|to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
|compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.
|
|Returns a list of B<[% pkg %]> objects when called in list context, or a
|reference to an C<ARRAY> of B<[% pkg %]> objects when called in scalar
| context.
|
|Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.iterate %]
|=head2 iterate
|
|  [%+ pkg %]->iterate( sub {
|      print $_->[% table.pk %] . "\n";
|  } );
|
|The C<iterate> method enables the processing of large tables one record at
|a time without loading having to them all into memory in advance.
|
|This plays well to the strength of SQLite, allowing it to do the work of
|loading arbitrarily large stream of records from disk while retaining the
|full power of Perl when processing the records.
|
|The last argument to C<iterate> must be a subroutine reference that will be
|called for each element in the list, with the object provided in the topic
|variable C<$_>.
|
|This makes the C<iterate> code fragment above functionally equivalent to the
|following, except with an O(1) memory cost instead of O(n).
|
|  foreach ( [% pkg %]->select ) {
|      print $_->[% table.pk %] . "\n";
|  }
|
|You can filter the list via SQL in the same way you can with C<select>.
|
|  [%+ pkg %]->iterate(
|      'order by ?', '[% table.pk %]',
|      sub {
|          print $_->[% table.pk %] . "\n";
|      }
|  );
|
|You can also use it in raw form from the root namespace for better control.
|Using this form also allows for the use of arbitrarily complex queries,
|including joins. Instead of being objects, rows are provided as C<ARRAY>
|references when used in this form.
|
|  [%+ root %]->iterate(
|      'select name from [% table.name %] order by [% table.pk %]',
|      sub {
|          print $_->[0] . "\n";
|      }
|  );
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.count %]
|=head2 count
|
|  # How many objects are in the table
|  my $rows = [% pkg %]->count;
|  
|  # How many objects 
|  my $small = [% pkg %]->count(
|      'where [% table.pk %] > ?',
|      1000,
|  );
|
|The C<count> method executes a C<SELECT COUNT(*)> query on the
|[%+ table.name %] table.
|
|It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
|C<FROM [% table.name %]> section of the query, followed by variables
|to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
|compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.
|
|Returns the number of objects that match the condition.
|
|Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.new %]
|=head2 new
|
|  TO BE COMPLETED
|
|The C<new> constructor is used to create a new abstract object that
|is not (yet) written to the database.
|
|Returns a new L<[% pkg %]> object.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.create %]
|=head2 create
|
|  my $object = [% pkg %]->create(
|[%+ FOREACH column IN table.columns %]
|      [%+ column.name %] => 'value',
|[%+ END %]
|  );
|
|The C<create> constructor is a one-step combination of C<new> and
|C<insert> that takes the column parameters, creates a new
|L<[% pkg %]> object, inserts the appropriate row into the
|L<[% table.name %]> table, and then returns the object.
|
|If the primary key column C<[% table.pk %]> is not provided to the
|constructor (or it is false) the object returned will have
|C<[% table.pk %]> set to the new unique identifier.
| 
|Returns a new L<[% table.name %]> object, or throws an exception on
|error, typically from the L<DBI> layer.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.insert %]
|=head2 insert
|
|  $object->insert;
|
|The C<insert> method commits a new object (created with the C<new> method)
|into the database.
|
|If a the primary key column C<[% table.pk %]> is not provided to the
|constructor (or it is false) the object returned will have
|C<[% table.pk %]> set to the new unique identifier.
|
|Returns the object itself as a convenience, or throws an exception
|on error, typically from the L<DBI> layer.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.delete %]
|=head2 delete
|
|  # Delete a single instantiated object
|  $object->delete;
|  
|  # Delete multiple rows from the [% table.name %] table
|  [%+ pkg %]->delete('where [% table.pk %] > ?', 1000);
|
|The C<delete> method can be used in a class form and an instance form.
|
|When used on an existing B<[% pkg %]> instance, the C<delete> method
|removes that specific instance from the C<[% table.name %]>, leaving
|the object ntact for you to deal with post-delete actions as you wish.
|
|When used as a class method, it takes a compulsory argument of a SQL
|phrase to be added after the C<DELETE FROM [% table.name %]> section
|of the query, followed by variables to be bound to the placeholders
|in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is compatible with SQLite can be used
|in the parameter.
|
|Returns true on success or throws an exception on error, or if you
|attempt to call delete without a SQL condition phrase.
|
[% END %]
[% IF method.truncate %]
|=head2 truncate
|
|  # Delete all records in the [% table.name %] table
|  [%+ pkg %]->truncate;
|
|To prevent the common and extremely dangerous error case where
|deletion is called accidentally without providing a condition,
|the use of the C<delete> method without a specific condition
|is forbidden.
|
|Instead, the distinct method C<truncate> is provided to delete
|all records in a table with specific intent.
|
|Returns true, or throws an exception on error.
